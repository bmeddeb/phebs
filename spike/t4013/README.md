# T40.13 neutral two-million-owner convergence gate

T40.13 runs the frozen T40.1 structural and semantic repositories through the
ordinary phebs server, scheduler, publication, recovery, archive, lifecycle,
and authorized product paths. The retained plan and receipt are source-free;
the authored bare repositories, data directories, logs, query text, returned
source, credentials, and process transcripts remain outside the repository and
are destroyed after the run.

## Prospective freeze

The execution commit is frozen before either giant repository is authored.
`t4013-freeze` verifies the exact retained T40.1 envelope, both manifests, and
the same-SHA blob-reader comparison before emitting a new plan. It refuses an
existing output.

```sh
go run ./spike/t4013/cmd/t4013-freeze \
  -root "$PWD" \
  -source-commit <exact-40-hex-execution-commit> \
  -output /absolute/dedicated/t4013/plan.json
```

The plan freezes 24 GiB memory and 120 GiB available-disk prerequisites, an
eight-hour total safety ceiling, 20 GiB peak RSS, 96 GiB maximum allocated data,
and the production five-attempt ceiling. These are stop/decision fences for one
neutral mechanics run, not a target SLO or supported-scale claim. They may not
be raised after any measurement begins.

The disk prerequisite reserves the existing filesystem's ten-percent hard
watermark plus two structural search-generation reservations. That is the
minimum shape needed to exercise B while retaining A and then return to A
without converting an expected production pressure refusal into an accidental
host-space result. The 96 GiB ceiling is the unchanged T40.5 retained-search
allocation envelope, not a new production allowance.

The decision rule is closed before the run:

- `continue` only when every exact mechanics gate passes inside production
  bounds and the frozen host-safety envelope;
- `reduce` when a production aggregate bound or host prerequisite refuses
  before complete authority;
- `cohort_experiment` when direct mechanics converge but a frozen wall, RSS,
  allocation, recovery, or collection review ceiling is crossed; and
- `p6_investigation` only when work multiplies by logical service count, cannot
  remain repository-bounded, or direct recovery cannot converge within fixed
  production bounds.

No threshold or production constant may be changed to turn a stop into a pass.

## Ordinary-worker sequence

The dedicated installation owns its port, data directory, scratch repositories,
archive, and credentials. It may not use or terminate either development-track
server. The fixed phase order is:

1. `preflight` — verify plan/source/tool identities, host capacity, empty
   custody paths, T40.5's effective go-git selection, and the small catalog.
2. `cold` — author revision A, start the ordinary server, and wait for exact
   source, search, observation, extraction-domain, resolver, posting, and
   relationship authority.
3. `warm_noop` — request the already-current generation again; require no Git
   or index child, publication write/transaction, or authority movement.
4. `delta_b` — advance only the frozen one-file B revision and prove that only
   its admitted partition changes.
5. `return_a` — advance to the frozen A-return tree, reproduce A content
   identity, and reuse the retained settled generation where specified.
6. `interruption` — stop one in-flight derived publication, restart the same
   binary, keep partial bytes invisible, and converge without moving stale
   authority current.
7. `stale_worker` — let a superseded lease finish and prove its final fence
   cannot publish.
8. `pressure` — exercise the real capacity gate and default-on bounded owner
   rotation without filling the filesystem or weakening the hard watermark.
9. `archive_restore` — create the production backup, restore into a separate
   empty dedicated installation, verify precious authority and explicit
   derived inclusion/omission, then converge.
10. `collection` — retain current, rollback, active lease, marker, and store-pin
    roots while bounded turns reclaim only eligible generations.
11. `authorized_query` — issue the fixed source-free query classes through an
    authenticated API client and retain only counts, equality, authorization,
    root/citation identity, and final-fence results.
12. `teardown` — remove derived data, scratch repositories, archive, raw
    artifacts, logs, and credentials.

Preparation refuses before authoring when the checkout differs from the plan,
the workspace is not a new real directory outside the module, or the host is
below either frozen prerequisite. Partial authoring is removed on error. The
two loopback installations use generated private bearer credentials and
separate ports/data roots:

```sh
go run ./spike/t4013/cmd/t4013-prepare \
  -root "$PWD" \
  -workspace /absolute/dedicated/t4013-custody \
  -plan /absolute/dedicated/t4013-plan.json \
  -output /absolute/dedicated/t4013-prepared.json \
  -base-port 41731 \
  -confirm prepare-neutral-t4013-custody
```

Execution builds the exact frozen checkout's ordinary server and pinned helper
binaries into custody, starts only the two assigned loopback instances, and
checks production controls plus authenticated HTTP surfaces. Its confirmation
authorizes removal of that exact external custody after either completion or a
measured stop. The source-free observation must be outside custody and must not
already exist:

```sh
go run ./spike/t4013/cmd/t4013-execute \
  -root "$PWD" \
  -plan /absolute/dedicated/t4013-plan.json \
  -prepared /absolute/dedicated/t4013-prepared.json \
  -observation /absolute/dedicated/t4013-observation.json \
  -confirm execute-neutral-t4013-and-destroy-custody
```

The structural repository contains 2,000,002 regular-file physical owners and
uses 512 reusable Go blobs. The semantic repository separately contains
262,144 unique Go blobs and 32,768 IDL inputs. A deliberately small catalog has
at most 100 accepted services; directory-prefix memberships and explicit
unowned prefixes cover the complete census while staying below the existing
v2 12,000-distinct-path cap. It is correctness control only and establishes no
service-cardinality result.

## Source-free receipt

The observation records closed phase outcomes and scalar accounting only:
wall/RSS, logical and allocated data, child counts, control/member reads,
publication and orchestration transactions, retries, and reuse. It contains no
repository name, path, object ID, source, query, response, host name, user, or
raw error. Skipped phases are `not_run`, never successful zero work.

RSS is the 250-millisecond peak of the ordinary server and its observed process
tree. Child counts are distinct observed PIDs classified as Git, index, or
other. Logical/allocated bytes are `du`'s apparent/allocated custody gauges at
the phase fence. Control/member reads count the validated bounded controls and
partition/member identities opened by the exact oracle. Publication writes and
transactions count changed authoritative plane identities; orchestration
transactions/retries and reuse come only from the closed job, candidate, and
extraction diagnostic schemas. They are mechanics counters, not kernel I/O or
database-profiler estimates.

```sh
go run ./spike/t4013/cmd/t4013-receipt \
  -plan /absolute/dedicated/t4013/plan.json \
  -plan-digest sha256:<exact-plan-digest> \
  -observation /absolute/dedicated/t4013/source-free-observation.json \
  -output spike/t4013/results.json
```

A completed receipt requires four exact T40.5 search-generation reader
receipts (structural A/B/A-return and semantic A), all with `mode=go_git`, zero
batch reads, and fallback reads equal to offered regular files. Every applicable
partition must settle, all required domains and relationship roots must publish,
and deliberately absent inputs plus unsupported syntax must remain explicit.
The warm no-op must have zero content children and publication mutations.

The result is mechanics evidence for one neutral environment only. It does not
establish a target SLO, supported service cardinality, accuracy, completeness,
freshness, release authority, private-rerun authority, migration completion, or
decommission safety. `GATE2-V2` remains `NOT_ESTABLISHED` and
`DO_NOT_RELEASE` remains in force.
