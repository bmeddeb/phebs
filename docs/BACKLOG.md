# phebs · active backlog

No implementation ticket is currently scheduled. Completed Epics 0–24 and P5
hardening are retained in the [completed backlog](./BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md).
Current posture and decision points are summarized in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

New work starts here only after its product boundary, dependencies, acceptance
criteria, and dated [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) decision are reviewed. Tickets remain
PR-sized and dependency-ordered for a stacked workflow.

## No scheduled tickets

The two identified next paths—production evidence/pilot gating and the P6 fleet
profile—remain explicitly gated or demand-driven in the roadmap. Neither is an
implicit next ticket.

## Deliberate non-goals *(per historical PORT_MAP §7/§12)*

SCIM provisioning, multi-org RBAC / seats, and a cloned "Ask" chat app —
phebs stays **MCP-first** (agents bring their own chat) and **single-tenant**.
Kubernetes/Helm waits for the P6 fleet profile. Anonymous-access and
entitlement gating are deleted outright (config bool, no license backend).

## Standing rules

- Decisions land as dated ADR bullets in PLAN.md, same PR as the change.
- Every epic ends with a `make dev` demo state — no epic is "done" if it
  can't be shown end-to-end.
- Upstream repo is behavior reference only; `ee/` paths never opened.
- Personal hardware, personal time, no employer code or credentials.
