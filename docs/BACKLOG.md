# phebs · active backlog

No implementation ticket is currently scheduled. Completed Epics 0–24 and P5
hardening are retained in the [completed backlog](./BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md).
Current posture and decision points are summarized in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

New work starts here only after its product boundary, dependencies, acceptance
criteria, and dated [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) decision are reviewed. Tickets remain
PR-sized and dependency-ordered for a stacked workflow.

## No scheduled tickets

The two identified next paths—production evidence/pilot gating and the P6 fleet
profile—remain explicitly gated or demand-driven in the roadmap. Neither is an
implicit next ticket. Epics 25–29 below are drafted but start only on an
explicit scheduling decision.

## Epic 25 · Embedded documentation browser *(drafted 2026-07-27 · unscheduled nice-to-have)*

Serve the repository's markdown documentation, rendered, from the phebs binary
itself. The tracked `docs/` tree stays the single source of truth: plain
markdown, still rendered identically by GitHub, with no external docs
toolchain, static-site generator, or content fork.

### Boundary

- One new pure-Go dependency (`goldmark` plus its GFM extension); no new
  runtime children and no build-pipeline stage.
- Served behind the existing session/API-key authentication like the UI; no
  anonymous surface and no new capability.
- `docs/fixtures/` and `docs/design_handoff_phebs_brand_and_ui/` are excluded
  from the embedded set; retained records remain repository-only.
- No docs versioning, search, or navigation chrome: `docs/README.md` and
  `docs/MANUAL.md` are the navigation, exactly as on GitHub.

**T25.1 · Rendered docs at their markdown URLs** — embed the tracked docs
markdown, docs SVGs, and `config.example.yaml`, plus root `README.md` and
`PLAN.md`, via `go:embed` (same build-tag pattern as `ui/`); render GFM to
HTML with goldmark once at startup; serve each page inside one branded HTML
shell at its repo-relative path under an authenticated docs route, so every
tracked relative link works unrewritten (`.md` URLs return HTML, SVG and YAML
pass through). AC: every local link the T24.1 contract test validates also
resolves in the served site; excluded fixture and design-handoff bytes are
absent from the binary; the route requires authentication; `make dev` demo —
open the served `docs/README.md`, follow a link into a task guide and the
architecture SVG; dated PLAN ADR bullet in the same PR; full merge bar.

## Epic 26 · SQL schema-set evidence *(drafted 2026-07-27 · unscheduled — spike first)*

Outline relational models from committed repository bytes: declaration-first,
usage-second, joined only through committed binding artifacts. Round one
scopes PostgreSQL and MySQL current-schema snapshots, including a requested
schema-only dump, plus schemas and authored queries bound by a committed sqlc
manifest. A dump alone is sufficient for a citable catalog when its committed
header establishes the dialect; the manifest is the stronger artifact that
deterministically ties an engine, schema files, and authored query files
together without inference.

### Boundary

- Pure reader over committed blobs at the indexed commit. No database
  connection, no `information_schema` introspection, no migration execution,
  no runtime naming resolution.
- PostgreSQL and MySQL are separate dialect lanes. A sqlc `engine` value or a
  recognized dump-generator header establishes the dialect; grammar sniffing
  never does. Headerless standalone schema files require a committed binding
  manifest. No assertion or measurement merges identities across dialects.
- Three evidence planes, no more:
  - `sql-schema` — current-schema declarations from a committed schema-only
    dump or from inputs explicitly listed by a committed sqlc manifest; the
    only source of `DECLARES_TABLE` / `DECLARES_COLUMN` / key, index, and
    FK-edge facts. Evidence records whether the source is an authored schema
    input or a captured dump; either proves only what the committed bytes say,
    never the live database. A dump without a query-binding manifest produces
    the catalog but no usage join.
  - `sql-query` — authored `.sql` query definitions producing read/write
    relation references. Generated `.sql.go` is never a primary usage source;
    it duplicates the authored query and joins later via generated-from
    evidence.
  - `sql-migration-event` — per-statement migration history
    (`MIGRATION_CREATES_TABLE`, `MIGRATION_ADDS_COLUMN`,
    `MIGRATION_DROPS_TABLE`, …) with **no current-shape claim**. No fold in
    round one: a folded "current schema" has no single citable blob under the
    extractor's streaming contract, and repeated alterations of one column
    need occurrence-distinct identities because assertion identity excludes
    detail.
- Shared join lineage `sql_schema_set_v1(repo, manifest-or-migration-root,
  dialect)`. An unqualified table literal stays a named-table reference until
  exactly one declaration set selects it; multiple candidate roots refuse as
  `ambiguous-schema-set`, never a repo-wide guess.
- Identifier canonicalization is dialect-specific. PostgreSQL quoted and
  unquoted identifiers retain their distinct rules. MySQL source spelling and
  quoting are preserved; absent committed server configuration, phebs never
  assumes a `lower_case_table_names` value or joins case variants.
- A repository with no admitted schema artifact reports
  `schema-artifact-missing` and may produce a checklist action to request a
  schema-only dump. The request and any human-supplied capture metadata are
  workflow state, not schema evidence; facts begin only when immutable dump
  bytes are available to the reader.
- Column references get their own eventual surface
  (`find_sql_column_references` over `(schema lineage, relation, column)`);
  the existing numeric wire-field surface stays byte-stable and untouched.
- Out of scope, stated as decisions: Redis (Epic 28 scopes deterministic
  declaration islands and provable key usage; a universal keyspace model
  stays out); raw document-store dialects (Epic 27
  instead proposes one employer-neutral normalized manifest); Cassandra/CQL
  and explicit-only ORM packs (separate later spikes with their own decision
  tables); any ER visualization (rendering is commodity once facts exist);
  the Workbench SQL resource plane (stays `unsupported` until a proven
  operation → query → table join exists).
- Same posture as every pack: experimental-dark, provisional lineage, honest
  abstention, no accuracy/completeness/runtime claim; production registration
  sits behind the documented validation and pilot-continuation gate.

### Safety boundary

- Spike artifacts live under `spike/t261/` as retained records; production
  packages must not import spike packages.
- A requested dump enters the pure-reader boundary only after it is committed
  to an indexed repository, including a dedicated evidence repository if the
  application source repository cannot own it. Ad hoc uploads and mutable
  filesystem paths are outside round one.
- Dump admission is schema-only and fails closed on data-bearing `COPY`,
  `INSERT`, `REPLACE`, or `LOAD DATA` sections. PostgreSQL dump wrappers and
  MySQL versioned comments, delimiters, engine/charset/collation clauses,
  prefix indexes, and generated-column syntax are parsed or reported by
  frozen abstention classes, never silently discarded. Repository placement
  and an optional human-asserted capture time do not establish database,
  cluster, environment, or runtime identity.
- Public corpus only; no employer names, code, schemas, or infrastructure.

**T26.1 · Pinned-corpus SQL evidence spike** — pin the public Hatchet
repository at `559b5021e418f12ded175f950b709b7fa66be5a5` (214 SQL migrations,
5 sqlc schema inputs, 36 authored query files, matching generated Go; FKs,
composite keys, CTEs, PL/pgSQL, triggers, partitions, and dynamic `EXECUTE`
for credible positives *and* honest abstentions). Pin the public
`ntppool/monitor` repository at
`e03c40a06ae8f9bd4906001c2ede0c7296ec8e96` for the MySQL lane: its committed
MySQL-compatible dump, sqlc `engine: mysql` manifest, authored query file, and
generated Go exercise FKs, composite keys, views, backticks, versioned
comments, engine/charset/collation clauses, joins, index hints, and
`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. Add one version-pinned PostgreSQL-generated
schema-only dump of a committed public fixture, retaining the exact generator
command, version, input digest, and output digest; together the real MySQL
dump and generated PostgreSQL dump validate the requested-dump path without
executing corpus SQL in production. Hand-label both dumps and all manifest
schema inputs completely, plus a preregistered stratified random sample of
migration and query files; freeze the sampling rule and all four measurement
denominators in the spike README **before** the first parser run. Evaluate at
least one imported parser candidate and one bounded subset grammar for each
dialect against identical gates (parser bounds, panic safety on the full
corpus, binary-size and build-time impact, byte-exact source positions,
deterministic double-run output). Freeze a decision table covering:
authored-schema versus captured-dump source classification; dialect admission
from committed metadata; schema-only admission and data-section refusal;
missing artifact/request-dump state; PostgreSQL and MySQL identifier
canonicalization (never generic lowercasing or an assumed
`lower_case_table_names` value); schema-set lineage and ambiguous-root
refusal; the exact `DECLARES_*` versus `MIGRATION_*` predicate split; FK
identity including composite-column order and multiple FKs between the same
table pair; common read/write semantics for `SELECT`, `INSERT … SELECT`,
`UPDATE`, and CTEs plus PostgreSQL `DELETE … USING` and MySQL multi-table
delete / `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`; generated-source deduplication;
occurrence-distinct migration-event identity; single-pass versus bounded
two-pass reads under the SDK's one-blob citation contract; and a frozen
per-dialect unresolved vocabulary (unsupported statement, dynamic identifier,
ambiguous schema set, unknown declaration, procedural SQL, generated
duplicate, parser gap). AC: locked corpus pins, generated-dump receipt, labels,
and measurements committed under `spike/t261/`; the decision table answers
every frozen question or records an explicit deferral; the measurement report
states four separate denominators for each dialect — declaration objects
parsed vs. hand labels, migration statements recognized vs. gaps by syntax
class, query table sites recognized vs. unresolved, and uniquely bound joins
vs. name-only/missing/ambiguous — with no cross-dialect blended percentage;
double-run bytes identical in both lanes; no production code paths changed
and no pack registered.

## Epic 27 · Document schema-manifest evidence *(drafted 2026-07-27 · unscheduled — spike first)*

Make schema-on-write document-store structure useful during everyday ticket
work without teaching phebs a private vendor or employer dialect. Round one
admits one project-owned, strict JSON interchange artifact,
`phebs-document-schema-v1`, produced by a repository author or an out-of-tree
adapter and committed at the indexed revision. It supplies an Atlas-shaped
catalog — schema set → table → nested field — plus ordered key, index,
association, and materialized-view declarations with exact citations.

The first workflow is deliberately declaration-only: locate the table a ticket
mentions, inspect its nested fields and exact type spellings, verify primary
and partition-key membership and order, follow explicitly declared
associations/views, and cite the committed snapshot. If the artifact is absent,
phebs reports a request-schema-export checklist state. It does not infer a
model from client code.

### Boundary

- Pure reader over one committed manifest blob at the indexed commit. No
  service connection, administrative API, runtime introspection, schema
  registry call, generator execution, or mutable upload.
- The manifest has a closed, versioned vocabulary for tables, flattened nested
  field paths, exact source type spellings, ordered primary and partition
  keys, ordered indexes, associations, and materialized views. A field path
  is a JSON array of typed segment objects — a field segment carrying one
  exact name, or a traversal segment from the closed set {array element, map
  value} — never a delimiter-split or escaped string, so every exact field
  name, including `[]`, remains representable. Primary-key, view-key, and
  index entries may carry an explicit `asc`/`desc` direction (default
  ascending); partition keys are path-only and carry no direction. An index
  column may carry an optional positive prefix length whose unit is defined
  by the declaring store — phebs cites it and never interprets or converts
  it. An index names an opaque, citable `kind` spelling and is owned by
  either a table or a view. A view declares its own output namespace:
  ordered output fields with exact names, each carrying zero or more source
  `(table, field-path)` references; view keys and view-owned indexes
  reference output paths only, and duplicate output names fail closed. Type
  and kind spellings are citable opaque declarations in round one; phebs
  does not invent cross-store equivalence.
- Lineage is
  `document_schema_set_v1(repo, manifest_path, format_version)`. Exact table
  spelling and exact field-path segments remain part of identity. Display
  labels, capture timestamps, source revision strings, repository placement,
  and adapter names never establish service, cluster, database, environment,
  ownership, deployment, or runtime identity.
- Every table declares a non-empty ordered primary key. An optional partition
  key must be a non-empty ordered path-prefix of that primary key, with
  direction excluded from the prefix comparison; an absent
  partition key means undeclared, never an assumed default. Associations are
  optional — some stores declare none — and the association graph may
  contain cycles, including self-associations: associations are declared
  edges phebs never traverses. View source references must form an acyclic
  dependency graph; a view-dependency cycle fails closed. Every referenced
  field path must resolve exactly within the same manifest; duplicate tables,
  fields, key entries, indexes, associations, or view identities fail closed.
- Associations are explicit logical edges, not foreign keys and not proof of
  referential integrity. A materialized view is a declared derived resource,
  not proof that it is deployed, fresh, populated, or read by code.
- An `authored` manifest records repository intent. A `captured` manifest
  records only the structure present in the supplied export. Both are
  committed declarations; neither is evidence of the live store. The source
  class is mandatory and the two classes are never silently merged.
- A repository with no admitted manifest reports
  `document-schema-artifact-missing` and may produce a checklist action to
  request a schema-only export in this neutral format. The request, adapter
  instructions, and human capture metadata are workflow state rather than
  schema evidence.
- The eventual catalog gets its own table and field identity surfaces; the
  numeric protocol field reader and Contract Atlas service identities remain
  unchanged. The Workbench document-store resource plane stays `unsupported`
  until a separate public contract can prove operation → usage → table
  relationships. Declaration-only catalog rows cannot populate that
  relationship registry.
- Raw proprietary schema files, private client APIs, private adapters,
  inferred client-code usage, query semantics, live-schema comparison, and
  cross-manifest current-shape folding are outside round one. An organization
  may maintain an adapter elsewhere, but only its normalized committed output
  crosses the phebs evidence boundary.
- Same posture as every pack: experimental-dark, provisional lineage, honest
  abstention, no accuracy/completeness/runtime claim; production registration
  sits behind the documented validation and pilot-continuation gate.

### Safety boundary

- Spike artifacts live under `spike/t271/` as retained records; production
  packages must not import spike packages.
- Strict decoding rejects unknown and duplicate object keys, invalid UTF-8,
  control text, invalid or unnormalized paths, unresolved references, cycles
  where the contract forbids them, unsupported format versions, trailing
  bytes, and any record/sample/default/example/value payload. The manifest is
  structural metadata only.
- Freeze limits before implementation for manifest bytes, tables, fields per
  table, path depth and segment bytes, type bytes, key width, indexes,
  associations, views, aggregate declarations, and emitted citations.
  Limit failures are typed abstentions; no partial catalog is emitted. phebs
  validates only these frozen bounds — store-vendor and deployment limits are
  never encoded or enforced.
- A captured export enters the reader only after immutable placement in an
  indexed repository, including a dedicated evidence repository if the
  application source repository cannot own it. No employer artifacts, names,
  code, credentials, hosts, or infrastructure enter phebs fixtures or retained
  records.

**T27.1 · Neutral document-schema contract spike** — freeze the
`phebs-document-schema-v1` JSON Schema, a neutral synthetic fixture family,
and one independently authored public-reference derivation before
implementing the reader. The positive synthetic fixtures cover nested
objects/lists/maps traversed through typed array-element and map-value
segments, a literal field exactly named `[]`, opaque scalar type spellings,
composite primary keys including a descending key column, path-only
partition-key prefixes, an undeclared partition key, multiple ordered
indexes including a store-defined prefix-length column, distinct opaque
index kinds, and a view-owned index over output paths, two associations
between the same table pair, a self-association, a table with no
associations, a materialized view with multi-source output fields, a
zero-source declared output field, and its own ordered keys over output
names, authored and captured source classes, and exact non-ASCII names. The
negative synthetic fixtures cover every strict-decoder, reference-integrity,
view-dependency-cycle, key-order, malformed-segment-object, duplicate
view-output-name, direction-on-partition-key, invalid direction or
prefix-length, data-payload, and size/depth refusal.

Pin the Apache-2.0 public `jeffreyscarpenter/cassandra-guide` repository at
commit `bed58e7e51768f9f30dd435e74f31e5b3b2649a4` and hand-derive one captured
neutral manifest from `resources/reservation.cql` (Git blob
`2c1c098ff706f63f28be772514e7b7a664878774`, 2,218 bytes, SHA-256
`38992bd1f0882ebefe7e16570d05886ade150bf2036ea6119ab08fc11b3bb39e`).
The source independently exercises a nested user-defined type, set/list/map
collections, a map value containing the nested type, scalar and composite
partition/clustering keys, and a materialized view. Retain the source pin,
license and digest receipt, plus a complete declaration-by-declaration
CQL-source → neutral-manifest derivation table with exact source spans and
explicit decisions for collection traversal, path-only partition prefixes,
default key direction, and view output fields. Freeze that derivation before
the reader's first run. The CQL file is an external oracle only: phebs neither
parses nor admits CQL in Epic 27, and this fixture makes no Cassandra-pack
claim. Synthetic fixtures remain authoritative for neutral-contract features
the public source does not contain.

Hand-label every synthetic declaration and refusal and every declaration in
the derived public manifest. Freeze a decision table covering
schema-set/table/field identity; source-class semantics; exact-name handling;
typed field-path segment representation; type, index-kind, and
prefix-length-unit opacity; key, index, association, and view semantics —
including per-column direction, path-only partition prefixes, view-owned
indexes, view output namespaces and their source references,
association-cycle legality versus view-dependency acyclicity, and
undeclared-partition-key meaning; source positions for every emitted object
and edge; missing-artifact/request-export state; single-snapshot versus
explicit two-snapshot comparison; canonical ordering; typed unresolved
vocabulary; and all parser/output bounds — phebs's own, with no vendor-limit
validation. Run a bounded reader twice over every fixture and compare
byte-identical facts, citations, catalog projection, refusal census, and
snapshot comparison. AC: schema, synthetic and public-derived fixtures,
source/digest/license receipt, complete derivation table, labels, decision
table, bounds, and measurements committed under `spike/t271/`; byte-exact
UTF-8 source spans round-trip to the cited JSON; the derived manifest is fully
accounted for against the pinned CQL without a parser; malformed, cyclic,
data-bearing, and oversized inputs fail without partial facts or panics; the
comparison distinguishes added/removed/changed declarations without calling
either snapshot live or current; the retained README demonstrates the
locate-table → inspect-key/field → copy-citation ticket workflow and the
missing-artifact checklist; no private dialect, adapter, CQL parser,
production code path, pack registration, or runtime claim is added.

## Epic 28 · Redis keyspace evidence *(drafted 2026-07-27 · unscheduled — spike first)*

A general Redis keyspace model is out of scope; deterministic Redis
declaration islands and provable key usage are in scope. Redis repositories
divide by the artifacts they commit, so round one is two spike lanes —
native declaration islands and key-specification-driven usage binding — and
the neutral keyspace manifest is explicitly deferred behind the spike's gap
measurement: it is drafted only if native declarations leave the expected
gap, entering as the same request-artifact workflow as the SQL dump and the
document-schema manifest.

### Boundary

- Pure reader over committed blobs at the indexed commit. No server
  connection, no `TYPE`/`SCAN` probing, no RDB/AOF inputs, no runtime state,
  and no claim that any cluster, database, or key exists.
- Lane one, native declaration islands: committed ACL key-pattern files and
  recognizable literal command vectors that declare indexes (`FT.CREATE`),
  time series (`TS.CREATE`, `TS.CREATERULE`), and stream groups
  (`XGROUP CREATE`). Core-command semantics come from the pinned command
  metadata; the named module subset uses bounded phebs-authored recognizers
  derived from public command documentation, not copied module source or
  metadata. An index schema is only the indexed projection over declared key
  prefixes, never a complete value model; a series or group declaration names
  a resource, not its entry fields. Most such declarations execute from
  application startup code, so this lane shares the command-vector machinery
  and its recognizer limits — the spike's headline number is what fraction of
  these declarations exist as recognizable committed literals at all.
- Redis object-mapping model classes are the strongest committed declaration
  artifact but sit across a language frontier; round one measures feasibility
  only and commits to no model-class reader.
- Lane two, usage binding over the Redis 7.2.15 command key specifications
  pinned below. Only provable command vectors bind: literal raw commands or
  arrays; one `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` major-version adapter whose
  method-to-command table is validated against each pinned corpus's exact
  dependency version; literal or same-file-constant key arguments; and
  bounded format expressions whose segment structure is statically known.
  Other client majors and unproved wrapper mappings abstain.
- Explicit `FCALL`/`EVAL` key lists can emit
  `PASSES_REDIS_KEY_TO_SCRIPT`: they prove only which keys the caller supplies
  under the command contract. They never inherit the script's read, write, or
  expected-value-kind semantics, and round one does not analyze function or
  script bodies.
- Access modes adopt the key-specification vocabulary verbatim — `RO`, `RW`,
  `OW`, `RM` with access/update/insert/delete detail — never flattened to
  read/write. `variable_flags` are resolved only when the admitted argument
  vector proves the applicable branch; otherwise access mode abstains as
  `variable-access-mode`. An incomplete specification may support a fact only
  when the exact key position and applicable flags are fixed for that admitted
  vector; every omitted or unknown position remains an
  `incomplete-key-specification` gap.
- Expected value kind is not present in the key specifications. It comes from
  a separate, frozen command-family table hand-labeled from public command
  documentation. A table entry may assert only what the code expects — for
  example, a hash command expects a hash — never runtime existence or type.
  Missing or argument-dependent entries yield
  `unknown-expected-value-kind` without discarding separately provable
  key/access evidence.
- ACL key patterns are a separate authorization-intent evidence class; they
  never declare key existence or value structure and are never merged with
  declaration or usage rows. An ACL fact may identify the exact username token
  as its authorization principal, but it proves neither authentication nor
  deployment. Only username-token and `%R~`/`%W~`/`%RW~`/`~` pattern-token
  spans may be emitted or cited. Cleartext-password tokens, password-hash
  tokens, command grants, and line-context snippets are neither retained nor
  rendered; diagnostics name only structural refusal classes.
- Frozen unresolved vocabulary: `dynamic-concatenation`, `opaque-helper`,
  `runtime-namespace`, `unknown-client-adapter`,
  `unsupported-core-command-after-pin`, `unsupported-module-command`,
  `incomplete-key-specification`, `variable-access-mode`,
  `unknown-expected-value-kind`, and `ambiguous-key-family`.
- The deferred `phebs-redis-keyspace-v1` manifest, if the gap measurement
  justifies it, declares key families as ordered structured binary-safe
  segments (literal, parameter, hash-tag grouping — typed segments, never
  format strings), with intended value kind, optional field intent, expiry
  intent, associated index/group/series resources, and authored/captured
  source class. Hash-tag validation uses the exact documented byte semantics
  without claiming a cluster exists. A concrete key or statically known
  format binds only when exactly one declared family matches; overlaps
  refuse as `ambiguous-key-family`, never precedence guessing.
- Out of scope as decisions: universal keyspace modeling; runtime
  introspection; RDB/AOF or any data-bearing input; the Workbench Redis
  resource plane (stays `unsupported`).
- Same posture as every pack: experimental-dark, provisional lineage, honest
  abstention, no accuracy/completeness/runtime claim; production
  registration sits behind the documented validation and pilot-continuation
  gate.

### Safety boundary

- Spike artifacts live under `spike/t281/` as retained records; production
  packages must not import spike packages.
- The only admitted upstream command-metadata bytes are Redis 7.2.15 commit
  `316753259b4db132cf494292a1b3a702d9e9ddb2`: BSD-3-Clause `COPYING` blob
  `a381681a1c2524ed586c6a87dfeb9ccdf1e86ded` and the 392 JSON files under
  `src/commands/` tree `59da020b9c7d8847fa0f7012b1fa2b3a09f47297`.
  T28.1 records per-file SHA-256 digests and a license receipt before use.
  Core commands added after that pin are unsupported.
- The named declaration subset (`FT.CREATE`, `TS.CREATE`,
  `TS.CREATERULE`) uses bounded phebs-authored recognizers derived from public
  command documentation. No Redis module implementation or metadata bytes
  enter the repository; every other module command is
  `unsupported-module-command`. Phebs parses committed source artifacts and
  neither links, embeds, starts, nor connects to Redis.
- ACL readers are token-streaming and output-safe by construction. Retained
  fixtures and test snapshots must prove that credentials adjacent to a
  pattern cannot enter facts, citations, diagnostics, logs, or rendered
  context.
- Public corpus only; no employer names, code, schemas, credentials, hosts, or
  infrastructure.

**T28.1 · Two-lane Redis evidence spike** — preregister these immutable public
inputs and their exact file scopes before the first recognizer run:
MIT-licensed `hibiken/asynq` commit
`d135f1439bee74e989b7f9b41ecd542cc87f024a` with
`github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` v9.14.1 for the broad usage census;
Apache-2.0 `cloudwego/eino-examples` commit
`6dc0d214c0eb392babf2d001e9be85f57ac10952` with go-redis v9.17.2 for
literal/constant raw-command and `FT.CREATE` declaration shapes; and the
Redis 7.2.15 pin above for command metadata plus the public ACL safety
fixtures. Record the hand-label sampling rule, source/license receipts, and
all denominators before execution. Measure separately, with no blended
percentage: declaration coverage (index/series/group sites with exactly
bindable identities versus dynamic construction — the manifest go/no-go
number); ACL username/pattern pairs parsed and credential-token non-retention;
recognized command sites versus unresolved by frozen shape class; resolved
key arguments; resolved access modes; expected-kind coverage; script-key
pass-through rows; and uniquely bound key spellings or families. Freeze a
decision table covering command-vector recognition and declaration
partial-fact atomicity; the go-redis method-to-command rule at both exact
versions with no cross-major claim; format-expression bounds;
incomplete-specification and `variable_flags` handling; exact access
vocabulary; the separately sourced expected-kind table;
`PASSES_REDIS_KEY_TO_SCRIPT`; ACL token-only citations; hash-tag byte
semantics; the clean-room named-module boundary; the object-mapping
feasibility verdict; and the explicit manifest go/no-go criterion. AC: pins,
receipts, labels, decision table, and measurements committed under
`spike/t281/`; double-run facts, citations, censuses, and retained outputs are
byte-identical; every refusal lands in the frozen vocabulary; an output scan
proves ACL credential tokens absent; no production code path changed and no
pack registered.

## Epic 29 · Workbench over real published evidence *(drafted 2026-07-28 · unscheduled)*

Bind the existing Change Workbench services to the store-derived Contract
Atlas so a workbench can target real published extraction evidence instead of
the synthetic fixture cohort. The T21 implementation is already
catalog-agnostic — the target resolver composes whatever Contract Atlas
service the instance serves — but the only binding path today is the
`PHEBS_SYNTHETIC_WORKBENCH` demo guard, which requires the Investigation and
Contract Atlas fixtures, and the atlas fixture replaces store-derived
contract evidence wholesale. This epic removes that constraint without
touching production registration: the roadmap's gate (retained validation
plus an explicit pilot-continuation decision) is unchanged, and a pilot needs
exactly this binding to exercise the workbench on real evidence.

### Boundary

- One new development-only flag, `experimental.provisional_workbench`; no new
  environment variables, routes, or capability identifiers. The flag
  conditionally registers the existing `change-workbench` and
  `change-workbench-evidence` surfaces. It is an overlay on an already-enabled
  provisional protobuf or Thrift extraction lane, not an independent
  authority to expose the evidence store: setting it without
  `experimental.provisional_proto_extraction` or
  `experimental.provisional_thrift_extraction` refuses startup as
  `workbench-evidence-prerequisite`.
- The synthetic fixture cohort (`PHEBS_SYNTHETIC_WORKBENCH` plus the
  Investigation, Contract Atlas, and closure-bundle fixtures) keeps working
  unchanged; `make dev` remains its demo path. The conflicting authorities are
  exact: setting the flag with `PHEBS_SYNTHETIC_WORKBENCH=1` or any non-empty
  `PHEBS_CONTRACT_ATLAS_FIXTURE` refuses startup as
  `workbench-authority-conflict`. Investigation fixtures and the closure
  repository are not catalog authorities and may coexist with the provisional
  binding; the latter still enters through ordinary sync, indexing, and
  extraction. Existing invalid-value and missing-fixture refusals for the
  synthetic adapter retain their current precedence when the provisional flag
  is unset.
- Workbench rows over provisional evidence inherit that evidence's posture:
  no runtime-use, completeness, compatibility, migration-completion,
  decommission-safety, or extraction-accuracy claim is created or implied.
- No UI change: the existing Workbench pages bind to whichever catalog the
  instance serves.

### Registration matrix

The matrix is evaluated after strict parsing of
`PHEBS_SYNTHETIC_WORKBENCH` (`""` or `"1"` only). “Declaration lane” means at
least one of provisional protobuf or provisional Thrift extraction is enabled.
Investigation fixtures and `PHEBS_WORKBENCH_CLOSURE_REPO` do not change the
result.

| `provisional_workbench` | Declaration lane | `PHEBS_SYNTHETIC_WORKBENCH` | Contract Atlas fixture | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `false` | any | empty | any | Existing non-Workbench behavior; no Workbench registration |
| `false` | any | `1` | present, with Investigation fixtures | Existing synthetic Workbench, byte-identical |
| `false` | any | `1` | absent, or Investigation fixtures absent | Existing synthetic missing-fixture refusal |
| `true` | present | empty | absent | Register the existing Workbench surfaces over store-derived published evidence |
| `true` | absent | empty | absent | Refuse `workbench-evidence-prerequisite` |
| `true` | any | `1` | any | Refuse `workbench-authority-conflict` |
| `true` | any | empty | present | Refuse `workbench-authority-conflict` |

### Documentation updates

T29.1 updates the owning documentation in the same PR as the implementation:

- `docs/config.example.yaml` adds
  `experimental.provisional_workbench: false`, its protobuf/Thrift extraction
  prerequisite, and its conflicts with the synthetic Workbench and Contract
  Atlas fixture authorities.
- `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md` documents the default-dark flag, the two typed
  startup refusals, and the complete registration matrix.
- `docs/guides/WORKFLOWS.md` distinguishes the existing fixture-backed
  `make dev` Workbench from the provisional Workbench over store-derived
  published evidence and retains the canonical evidence caveats.
- `docs/guides/OPERATIONS.md` documents startup diagnostics and a bounded
  operator smoke using `phebs-everything.yaml`; remote-HEAD results are a
  manual observation, never a deterministic merge-bar input or retained
  accuracy claim.
- `phebs-everything.yaml` opts into the Workbench flag and remains an isolated
  local evaluation configuration; `make dev` and `make dev-api` remain
  byte-identical fixture-backed demonstrations.
- The dated PLAN completion ADR records the implemented authority checks,
  service binding, validation result, and unchanged production gate.

**T29.1 · Provisional workbench binding over the store-derived catalog** —
construct the workbench service, target resolver, and the
impact/implementation/checklist evidence services when
`experimental.provisional_workbench` and at least one provisional protobuf or
Thrift extraction lane are set, with no fixture requirement; the flag does not
independently bind `Options.Evidence`, and the boot warning names the
provisional posture like the extraction flags. Prefer the already-constructed
Contract Atlas service when building the target resolver so the Workbench and
the instance cannot select different catalog authorities. AC: every row in
the registration matrix is pinned, including the two typed refusal classes;
with the flag, a declaration lane, and no conflicting authority, the existing
Workbench routes and capability identifiers bind and a Workbench resolves
targets against the instance's own published operations; with the flag alone,
startup refuses rather than exposing persisted evidence through a new path;
with the fixtures set and the flag unset, behavior is byte-identical to today.
A deterministic local acceptance publishes evidence through the ordinary
worker/store path and exercises Workbench target resolution without a Contract
Atlas fixture; a separately documented manual smoke using
`phebs-everything.yaml` reaches a Workbench over public real published evidence
after sync/index/extraction, while the `make dev` synthetic demo remains
unchanged. Complete every item in **Documentation updates**; retain the
canonical no-runtime-use/no-completeness/no-migration-completion/
no-decommission-safety/no-extraction-accuracy posture; full merge bar.

## Deliberate non-goals *(per historical PORT_MAP §7/§12)*

SCIM provisioning, multi-org RBAC / seats, and a cloned "Ask" chat app —
phebs stays **MCP-first** (agents bring their own chat) and **single-tenant**.
Kubernetes/Helm waits for the P6 fleet profile. Anonymous-access and
entitlement gating are deleted outright (config bool, no license backend).

## Standing rules

- Decisions land as dated ADR bullets in PLAN.md, same PR as the change.
- Every epic ends with a `make dev` demo state — no epic is "done" if it
  can't be shown end-to-end.
- Upstream repo is behavior reference only; `ee/` paths never opened.
- Personal hardware, personal time, no employer code or credentials.
