# phebs · active backlog

No implementation ticket is currently scheduled. Completed Epics 0–24 and P5
hardening are retained in the [completed backlog](./BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md).
Current posture and decision points are summarized in
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

New work starts here only after its product boundary, dependencies, acceptance
criteria, and dated [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) decision are reviewed. Tickets remain
PR-sized and dependency-ordered for a stacked workflow.

## No scheduled tickets

The two identified next paths—production evidence/pilot gating and the P6 fleet
profile—remain explicitly gated or demand-driven in the roadmap. Neither is an
implicit next ticket. Epic 25 below is drafted but starts only on an explicit
scheduling decision.

## Epic 25 · Embedded documentation browser *(drafted 2026-07-27 · unscheduled nice-to-have)*

Serve the repository's markdown documentation, rendered, from the phebs binary
itself. The tracked `docs/` tree stays the single source of truth: plain
markdown, still rendered identically by GitHub, with no external docs
toolchain, static-site generator, or content fork.

### Boundary

- One new pure-Go dependency (`goldmark` plus its GFM extension); no new
  runtime children and no build-pipeline stage.
- Served behind the existing session/API-key authentication like the UI; no
  anonymous surface and no new capability.
- `docs/fixtures/` and `docs/design_handoff_phebs_brand_and_ui/` are excluded
  from the embedded set; retained records remain repository-only.
- No docs versioning, search, or navigation chrome: `docs/README.md` and
  `docs/MANUAL.md` are the navigation, exactly as on GitHub.

**T25.1 · Rendered docs at their markdown URLs** — embed the tracked docs
markdown, docs SVGs, and `config.example.yaml`, plus root `README.md` and
`PLAN.md`, via `go:embed` (same build-tag pattern as `ui/`); render GFM to
HTML with goldmark once at startup; serve each page inside one branded HTML
shell at its repo-relative path under an authenticated docs route, so every
tracked relative link works unrewritten (`.md` URLs return HTML, SVG and YAML
pass through). AC: every local link the T24.1 contract test validates also
resolves in the served site; excluded fixture and design-handoff bytes are
absent from the binary; the route requires authentication; `make dev` demo —
open the served `docs/README.md`, follow a link into a task guide and the
architecture SVG; dated PLAN ADR bullet in the same PR; full merge bar.

## Deliberate non-goals *(per historical PORT_MAP §7/§12)*

SCIM provisioning, multi-org RBAC / seats, and a cloned "Ask" chat app —
phebs stays **MCP-first** (agents bring their own chat) and **single-tenant**.
Kubernetes/Helm waits for the P6 fleet profile. Anonymous-access and
entitlement gating are deleted outright (config bool, no license backend).

---

## Standing rules

- Decisions land as dated ADR bullets in PLAN.md, same PR as the change.
- Every epic ends with a `make dev` demo state — no epic is "done" if it
  can't be shown end-to-end.
- Upstream repo is behavior reference only; `ee/` paths never opened.
- Personal hardware, personal time, no employer code or credentials.
